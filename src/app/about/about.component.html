<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p><i>Building and designing elegant solutions to everyday problems.</i></p>

<p>I’m Christopher “Chris” Schedler, a Kansas City-based software engineer specializing in front-end development. My
  passion is building intuitive, visually appealing, and user-friendly web applications that make technology effortless
  for people to use.</p>

<p>This blog documents my professional journey, shares insights into modern web development, and offers resources for
  aspiring developers. My goal is to inspire more people to explore software engineering, UI/UX design, and the art of
  crafting seamless digital experiences.</p>

<h2>Professional Background</h2>

<p>Since 2012, I’ve worked as a full-stack software engineer in downtown Kansas City, using:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Front-End:</b> JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS3, Angular</li>
  <li><b>Back-End:</b> Java, Oracle, MSSQL, and related technologies</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Development Philosophy</h2>

<ol>
  <li><b>Intuitive</b> - Users shouldn’t need a manual to get started.</li>
  <li><b>Engaging</b> - Interfaces should be visually pleasing and responsive.</li>
  <li><b>Reliable</b> - Applications should perform well and be easy to maintain.</li>
</ol>

<p>I bring this mindset to every project I work on, ensuring each line of code contributes to a better user experience.
</p>

<h2>Beyond the Code</h2>

<p>When I'm not writing code, I'm often:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Competing in Endurance Sports</b> - From high school cross country to triathlons, including swimming, biking,
    and running events.</li>
  <li><b>Gaming</b> - Strategy games (StarCraft, Clash Royale), competitive chess (state champions in 2002), and classic
    card games.</li>
  <li><b>Following Sports</b> - Dedicated fan of Sporting Kansas City, Manchester City, and the Kansas City Chiefs.</li>
  <li><b>Reading</b> - Enthusiast of science fiction, fantasy, self-improvement, technology, and autobiographies.</li>
</ul>
