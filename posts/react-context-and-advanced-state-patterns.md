### React Context and Advanced State Patterns

September 29th, 2025

#### Intro

Welcome to **Part 4 of the React & Gatsby Learning Series**!  
In this series, Iâ€™m helping Angular developers (and front-end devs in general) understand React and Gatsby step by step. Each post builds on the last, includes a practical project, and highlights key comparisons between Angular and React (and later, Scully and Gatsby).

#### The Problem: Prop Drilling

In the last post, we built a Todo app and introduced state management with `useState`. But what happens when you need to pass data several levels deep?

Example scenario:

- `App` component â†’ passes user data â†’ `Header` â†’ `NavBar` â†’ `ProfileLink`

This creates **prop drilling** â€” passing props through multiple components that donâ€™t actually use them, just to reach a deeply nested child.

- **Angular comparison**: In Angular, youâ€™d often use a **Service with dependency injection** to share state across components.
- **React solution**: Use the **Context API** to avoid manual prop chains.

#### The Context API

Reactâ€™s **Context API** provides a way to share values (state, functions, themes, etc.) across the component tree without passing props manually.

**Steps to use Context:**

1. Create a context object with `createContext`.
2. Wrap components with a `Provider`.
3. Consume the context using `useContext`.

**Example â€“ Theme Context:**

```jsx
import { createContext, useContext, useState } from "react";

// 1. Create the context
const ThemeContext = createContext();

// 2. Create a provider component
function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState("light");

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setTheme((prev) => (prev === "light" ? "dark" : "light"));
  };

  return <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, toggleTheme }}>{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>;
}

// 3. Custom hook for convenience
function useTheme() {
  return useContext(ThemeContext);
}

// Example consumer component
function ThemeButton() {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme();
  return <button onClick={toggleTheme}>Current theme: {theme} (click to toggle)</button>;
}

// Usage in App.jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <h1>Welcome to the app!</h1>
      <ThemeButton />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- `ThemeProvider` wraps the app and supplies values to all descendants.

- `useTheme()` makes consuming the context easier and cleaner.

#### When to Use Context

- Ideal for **global state** like themes, authentication, or user settings.

- Avoid using it for everything â€” large-scale state often benefits from **state management libraries** like Redux or Zustand.

Think of Context as a **lightweight shared state solution**.

---

#### Beyond Context: useReducer

For complex state updates (like managing objects or multiple transitions), `useReducer` can be a cleaner alternative to `useState`.

**Example â€“ Todo Reducer**:

```jsx
import { useReducer } from "react";

function todoReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "ADD_TODO":
      return [...state, action.payload];
    case "REMOVE_TODO":
      return state.filter((_, i) => i !== action.index);
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

function TodoApp() {
  const [todos, dispatch] = useReducer(todoReducer, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "ADD_TODO", payload: "New Task" })}>Add Task</button>
      <ul>
        {todos.map((todo, i) => (
          <li key={i}>
            {todo} <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "REMOVE_TODO", index: i })}>Remove</button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default TodoApp;
```

- Reducers follow a **predictable state transition pattern**.

- Similar to **NgRx in Angular**, but built directly into React.

#### Hands-On Project: Global Theme Switcher

Letâ€™s enhance our Todo app by giving it a **global theme** toggle with Context.

1. Create a `ThemeContext` with `createContext`.

2. Wrap the Todo app with `ThemeProvider`.

3. Use `useContext` to switch styles across the app.

This allows every component (buttons, inputs, lists) to respond to the global theme without passing props down manually.

#### Closing

âœ… That wraps up **Part 4: React Context and Advanced State Patterns** of the React & Gatsby Learning Series!

Key takeaways from this post:

- Prop drilling makes data sharing tedious in nested components.

- Reactâ€™s **Context API** provides a simple solution for global state.

- `useReducer` is useful for managing complex state logic.

- This mirrors Angularâ€™s **Services and dependency injection** vs Reactâ€™s Context.

- You extended your Todo app with a **global theme switcher**.

In the next part, weâ€™ll cover **React Routing and Navigation Patterns**, where weâ€™ll build multi-page apps using React Router.

ðŸ‘‰ If you found this helpful, follow the series, share with fellow Angular devs, and start experimenting with Context in your own apps!
